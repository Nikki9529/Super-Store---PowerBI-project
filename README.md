Objective:

To contribute to the success of a business by utilizing Data Analysis techniques, specifically focusing on time-series Analysis, to provide valuable insights and accurate Sales forecasting.

Data Analysis Steps:
1. Import data into PowerBI and clean the data for errors.
2. Dashboard creation: Identifying the KPIs, and creating several graphical visuals.
3. DAX Queries and Data Analysis: Created a few necessary columns in the data set to analyze the data more efficiently.
4. Sales Forecasting: Leverage historic data and applied time series to generate sales forecasts for the next 15 days.
5. Created a New table for forecasted data analysis using DAX Queries.
6. Added a few Slicers for a better and easy understanding of the data.


Few Insights from the Analysis (As per Me):
1. The Sales are usually high in the month of July till December. The Store needs to keep the same trend.
2. The profit for the Store keeps on fluctuating month to month. Since Sales are high in July till December the profits are also high during those Quarters.
3. In the Month of March 2020 there was a sudden increase in the profits of the Store in spite of fewer Sales in that month. The Store needs to consider this and act accordingly.
4. The Average delivery date for products to reach its customers is 4 days which is very bad for the Store and the Store will have to change its Logistics plans in order to cut short the Delivery date since most customers are preferring Standard class of Delivery.
5. The States with the highest sales are California, followed by New York and Texas.
6. From the Sales Forecast which was made for 15 days, we can finally conclude that the sales for the next 15 days will be around 5000 with an Upper band of 9000 to Lower band of 1200.
